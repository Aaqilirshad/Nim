# Nim AI Project

This project is a part of the CS50 AI course, where I developed an AI that learns to play the game of Nim using reinforcement learning. The AI improves its strategy by playing against itself multiple times and eventually plays very well against a human opponent.

## Introduction
The game of Nim is a mathematical strategy game where players take turns removing objects from heaps or piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object from a single pile, and they may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same pile. The player forced to take the last object loses.

In this project, I implemented a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play Nim by improving its strategy through self-play.
